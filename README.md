# StockProject

To purchase stocks, go to http://localhost:3000/purchases and input a ticker and amount you are going to spend. You will then
be routed to a page displaying the stock purchase, or an error message if there was a failure. 

For a database, I used MongoDB with the mongoose library to connect to a remote instance of a MongoDB. I'll admit that I'm not 
very well versed in setting up new projects, but I don't think that you'll have to do anything on your side to interact with this db.
I whitelisted all IPs and while the url in server.js is defaulted to my users credentials, I added a new account with the credentials

User: PenscoAdmin
PW: AdminPassword

If you'd like to play around with that. 

As you can see, I ended up using NodeJS/Express, which I've never actually used, but I figured it would be a fun way to get my foot in
the door with them and learn the basics. I think that I have some of the basics down and being and ex AngularJS dev helped, but I clearly
still have a lot to learn. 

I don't think that any other dependencies are needed to be downloaded... but I could be totally wrong and if so, it shows that I still
have plenty to learn. 

Thank you for giving me this opportunity!
